#LEARNING FROM MOCK_1
#1.Yes I completed all my tasks given assignments,lessons etc. way before last date arrived.
#2.I was quite confident about the topics discussed in lessons .Few topics like generators
#  and also yield statement I wasn't confident about it.
#3.A day before exam I practiced and revised all topics and forums questions to be sure not to
#  to miss any topic.I was having mixed feelings-quite anxious and nervous too as it was first one.
#4.During the test I made sure I don't hush to complete all the questions instead concentrate on the
#  question I'm working and debug it with  the given specs given in question.
#5.I think I'll get above 25 and below 40 as I attempted only 2 questions perfectly.
#6.I scored 33 marks as expected.
#7.I learnt that I need to be very quick at understanding the question and writing the logic in code format
#  because debugging needs time.Anyways it was a good experience to learn from this test. :)
